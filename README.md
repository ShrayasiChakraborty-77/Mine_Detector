# Sonar System for Detecting Underwater Mines
## üåä Project Overview
This project presents a **Sonar-Based Detection System** designed to identify and map underwater mines to protect marine ecosystems and prevent water pollution. Underwater mines, often remnants of past military conflicts, pose serious threats to marine biodiversity and human safety due to their explosive nature and the toxic substances they release into aquatic environments.
The proposed solution utilizes sonar technology to detect these threats by emitting high-frequency sound waves and analyzing their reflections. The system is aligned with key global sustainability goals:
- **SDG 14: Life Below Water**
- **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**

## üß™ Features
- High-frequency **sonar emission and reflection analysis**
- **Real-time signal processing** for object detection
- **Threat classification** using echo pattern recognition
- **Alert system** for immediate threat response
- **Prototype implementation and evaluation** in controlled aquatic environments
